# Change log

## 2026-08-05 — M0 repository workflow baseline

- Branch: `dev/atomic-robocasa365`
- Base commit: `72cfb86`
- Runtime status: local static validation passed; cluster validation pending

### Problem

The fork had no repository-specific collaboration rules, implementation roadmap, progress record, cluster feedback contract, or documentation enforcement. The existing global `*.sh` ignore rule would also prevent future Slurm and launch scripts from being versioned.

### Added logic

- Defined atomic-only scope, local/cluster ownership, validation states, and adapter boundaries.
- Added a milestone plan from native RoboCasa365 loading through atomic-only training and evaluation.
- Added a repository workflow skill that guides future modifications and cluster feedback handling.
- Added a deterministic Git-diff check requiring change and progress documentation for implementation/workflow changes.
- Included untracked files in the documentation check so newly created implementation files cannot bypass it.
- Added Starlight model locations, checkout procedure, validation levels, and a structured debug report template.
- Removed the global shell-script ignore rule so future cluster scripts can be committed intentionally.

### Compatibility and risk

- No model, dataset, training, or evaluation runtime behavior is changed in M0.
- The local machine cannot validate Torch/CUDA behavior.
- The repository's third-party submodules are not initialized locally.

### Validation

- Skill structure: passed with the skill-creator validator.
- Documentation enforcement script: passed against the complete branch working diff.
- Python syntax compilation: passed for repository and skill Python sources without importing Torch.
- Git whitespace/error check: passed.
- Cluster checkout: pending.

### Rollback

Revert the M0 commit. No external data, checkpoint, or simulator state is modified.
